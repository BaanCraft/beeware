This handler first confirms if the application has permission to take a photo; if permission doesn't exist, it is requested. Then, a photo is taken. The request for permission and the request to take a photo are both asynchronous requests, so they require the use of ``await``; while the app is waiting for the user to confirm permissions or take the photo, the app's event loop can continue in the background."

If the user doesn't grant permission to use the camera, or the camera isn't implemented on the current platform, an error will be raised, and a dialog will be shown to the user."
