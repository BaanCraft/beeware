msgid "Welcome to BeeWare! In this tutorial, we're going to build an graphical user interface using Python, and deploy it as a desktop application, as a mobile application, and as a single page web app. We're also going to look at how you can use BeeWare tools to do some of the common tasks that you'll need to do as an app developer, such as testing your app."
