Any change to descriptions, version numbers, colors, or permissions will require a re-create step. Because of this, while you are developing your project, you shouldn't make any manual changes to the contents of the ``build`` folder, and you shouldn't add the ``build`` folder to your version control system. The ``build`` folder should be considered entirely ephemeral - an output of the build system that can be recreated as needed to reflect the current configuration of your project."
