msgid "The Toga Web backend is the least mature of all the Toga backends. It's mature enough to show off a few features, but it's likely to be buggy, and will be missing many of the widgets that are available on other platforms. At this point in time, Web deployment should be considered a \"Proof of Concept\" - enough to demonstrate what can be done, but not enough to be relied on for serious development."

msgid "The process of deploying as a single-page web app follows the same familiar pattern - you create the application, then build the application, then run it. However, Briefcase can be a little bit smart; if you attempt to run an application, and Briefcase determines that it hasn't been created or built for the platform being targeted, it will do the create and build steps for you. Since this is our first time running the app for the web, we can perform all three steps with one command:"

Briefcase packages your app's code as wheels that PyScript can load in the browser. When the page is loaded, the application code runs in the browser, building the UI using the browser DOM. When you click a button, that button runs the event handling code in the browser."
