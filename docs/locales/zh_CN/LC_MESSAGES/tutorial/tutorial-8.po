If you open ``https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/42`` in your browser, you'll get a JSON payload describing a single post - some `Lorum ipsum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum>`__ content for a blog post with ID 42."

They are good implementations of the HTTP protocol - but they require the user to manage lots of low-level details, like URL redirection, sessions, authentication, and payload encoding. As a \"normal browser user\" you're probably used to taking these details for granted, as a browser manages them for you."
